        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <h2>Hi there, I'm Jenny Zhang!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a junior software developer as of January 2024, using Javascript
          and SQL database to create full-stack applications/web. Excited to
          embark on an exciting journey into tech, contribute my knowledge and
          skills into the industury, aspired to join the game sector
          specifically. And to learn new languages to further enrich my personal
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, I also make small projects here and there, you can check them out

          <h3>Animal Crossing DOM Matching Game</h3>
          <p>
            As a part of the Northcoder's Software Development bootcamp, one of
            the lessons were to ultilise the
            <span class="emphasis">DOM</span> to manipulate
            <span class="emphasis">HTML </span>pages, as the sprint did not get
            completed. I took the liberty to further consolidate my
            understanding of DOM with this simple and quick mini game, styled
            with <span class="emphasis">CSS</span>.
          </p>

          <h3>2024 Meet Me in the Middle/MMITM</h3>
          <p>
            A full stack application made using:
            <span class="emphasis">Firebase</span> forbackend database storage,
            authentification and hosting,
            <span class="emphasis">TypeScript</span> as the main language, a
            mixture of <span class="emphasis">Google API</span> calls to
            retrieve relevent information and styled with a combination of
            <span class="emphasis">Tailwind and Daisy UI</span>. This app was
            created with a collaborative effort from 3 other students at
            Northcoder's, challenging us to learn and explore new technology
            available to use, allowing freedome and creativity during this
            process.

          <h3>2023 NC News Front end project</h3>
          <p>
            A solo front-end project making calls to the backend API, also
            produced by myself during my time at Northcoder's. This app was
            created with <span class="emphasis">Vite</span> and
            <span class="emphasis">React</span> to produce a user friendly
            interface to navigate through the app, with functions mimicking an
            already existing web page such as Reddit. To further refine this
            project, styling changes were made after core components were
            completed using <span class="emphasis">Chakra UI</span> and <span class="emphasis">CSS</span>. Final
            application is hosted through
            <span class="emphasis">Netlify App</span>!

          <p>Backend Project using <span class="emphasis">PostgresSQL</span> to access and store databases, tested vigorously through happy and sad paths of each <span class="emphasis">CRUD</span> method to respond appriopriately with <span class="emphasis">Jest</span> as a form of unit testing. To handle server side requests, <span class="emphasis">Express.js</span> was used when building the routes for each request. <span class="emphasis">MVC (Model-view-controller)</span> was used as a method to keep code concise and tidy. Final version hosted by Render and the data is held by ElephantSQL</p>
