          <h3>Animal Crossing DOM Matching Game</h3>
          <p>As a part of the Northcoder's Software Development bootcamp, one of the lessons were to ultilise the <span class="emphasis">DOM</span> to manipulate HTML pages, as the sprint did not get completed. I took the liberty to further consolidate my understanding of DOM with this simple and quick mini game, styled with <span class="emphasis">CSS</span>.</p>

          <h3>2024 Meet Me in the Middle/MMITM</h3>
          <p>A full stack application made using: <span class="emphasis">Firebase</span> forbackend database storage, authentification and hosting, <span class="emphasis">TypeScript</span> as the main language, a mixture of <span class="emphasis">Google API</span> calls to retrieve relevent information and styled with a combination of <span class="emphasis">Tailwind and Daisy UI</span>. This app was created with a collaborative effort from 3 other students at Northcoder's, challenging us to learn and explore new technology available to use, allowing freedome and creativity during this process. </p>
